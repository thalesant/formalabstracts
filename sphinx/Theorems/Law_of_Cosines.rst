Law of Cosines
--------------

This article gives a formal statement of Law of Cosines.  For Wikipedia's
description, see
`Law of Cosines <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_cosines>`_.


informally

  In trigonometry, the law of cosines (also known as the cosine formula, cosine rule, or Al-Kashi's theorem) relates the lengths of the sides of a triangle to the cosine of one of its angles. The law of cosines states

  .. math::
      {\displaystyle C^{2}=A^{2}+B^{2}-2AB\cos \gamma ,}

  where :math:`γ` denotes the angle contained between sides of lengths :math:`A` and :math:`B` and opposite the side of length :math:`C`. For the same figure, the other two relations are analogous:
  
  .. math::
    {\displaystyle A^{2}=B^{2}+C^{2}-2BC\cos \alpha ,}
    
    {\displaystyle B^{2}=A^{2}+C^{2}-2AC\cos \beta .}

  Notions: a b c three points in R^2

  Angle a b c: arccos(((a.1-b.1)*(c.1-b.1)+(a.2-b.2)*(c2-b2))/(dist(a b)*dist(c b)))  
  theorem: A^2=B^2+C^2-2*BC cos(angle(b a c)) (A=dist(b c), B=dist(a c), C=dist(a b))
