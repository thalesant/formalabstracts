Sylow's Theorem
---------------

This article gives a formal statement of Sylow's Theorem.  For Wikipedia's
description, see
`Sylow's Theorem <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylow_theorems>`_.


informally

  In mathematics, specifically in the field of finite group theory, the Sylow theorems
  are a collection of theorems that give detailed information about the number of subgroups
  of fixed order that a given finite group contains.

  The following theorems were first proposed and proven by Ludwig Sylow in 1872.

  Theorem 1: For every prime factor `p` with multiplicity `n` of the order of 
  a finite group `G`, there exists a Sylow `p`-subgroup of `G`, of order :math:`p^n`.

  Theorem 2: Given a finite group `G` and a prime number `p`,
  all Sylow `p`-subgroups of `G` are conjugate to each other,
  i.e. if `H` and `K` are Sylow `p`-subgroups of `G`,
  then there exists an element `g` in `G` with :math:`g^{−1}Hg = K`.


preformally

  G: finite group
  p: prime factor with multiplicity `n` of the order of the order of G

  Theorem 1: There exists a Sylow p-subgroup H of G such that 
  the order of H is p ^ n.
  
  
  Theorem 2: If H and K are Sylow p-subgroups of G then
  ∃ g : G such that g^{−1}Hg = K.
